\title{Save an H2O Model Object to Disk}
\usage{
h2o.saveModel(object, path = "", force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an \linkS4class{H2OModel} object.}

\item{path}{string indicating the directory the model will be written to.}

\item{force}{logical, indicates how to deal with files that already exist.}
}
\description{
Save an \linkS4class{H2OModel} to disk. (Note that ensemble binary models 
can be saved.)
}
\details{
In the case of existing files \code{force = TRUE} will overwrite the file.
Otherwise, the operation will fail.

The owner of the file saved is the user by which H2O cluster was executed.
