\title{Get a grid object from H2O distributed K/V store.}
\usage{
h2o.getGrid(grid_id, sort_by, decreasing)
}
\arguments{
\item{grid_id}{ID of existing grid object to fetch}

\item{sort_by}{Sort the models in the grid space by a metric. Choices are "logloss", "residual_deviance", "mse", "auc", "accuracy", "precision", "recall", "f1", etc.}

\item{decreasing}{Specify whether sort order should be decreasing}
}
\description{
Note that if neither cross-validation nor a 
validation frame is used in the grid search, then the training metrics will display in the 
"get grid" output. If a validation frame is passed to the grid, and nfolds = 0, then the 
validation metrics will display. However, if nfolds > 1, then cross-validation metrics will 
display even if a validation frame is provided.
