\title{Transform words (or sequences of words) to vectors using a word2vec model.}
\usage{
\S4method{h2o.transform}{H2OWordEmbeddingModel}(model, words, aggregate_method = c("NONE", "AVERAGE"))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A word2vec model.}

\item{words}{An H2OFrame made of a single column containing source words.}

\item{aggregate_method}{Specifies how to aggregate sequences of words. If method is `NONE`
then no aggregation is performed and each input word is mapped to a single word-vector.
If method is 'AVERAGE' then input is treated as sequences of words delimited by NA.
Each word of a sequences is internally mapped to a vector and vectors belonging to
the same sentence are averaged and returned in the result.}

\description{
Transform words (or sequences of words) to vectors using a word2vec model.

\examples{
\dontrun{
h2o.init()

# Build a simple word2vec model
data <- as.character(as.h2o(c("a", "b", "a")))
w2v_model <- h2o.word2vec(data, sent_sample_rate = 0, min_word_freq = 0, epochs = 1, vec_size = 2)

# Transform words to vectors without aggregation
sentences <- as.character(as.h2o(c("b", "c", "a", NA, "b")))
h2o.transform(w2v_model, sentences) # -> 5 rows total, 2 rows NA ("c" is not in the vocabulary)

# Transform words to vectors and return average vector for each sentence
h2o.transform(w2v_model, sentences, aggregate_method = "AVERAGE") # -> 2 rows
}
