\usage{

\arguments{
\item{object}{an \code{H2OConnection} object.}
}
\description{
This class represents a connection to an H2O cloud.
}
\details{
Because H2O is not a master-slave architecture, there is no restriction on which H2O node
is used to establish the connection between R (the client) and H2O (the server).

A new H2O connection is established via the h2o.init() function, which takes as parameters
the `ip` and `port` of the machine running an instance to connect with. The default behavior
is to connect with a local instance of H2O at port 54321, or to boot a new local instance if one
is not found at port 54321.
